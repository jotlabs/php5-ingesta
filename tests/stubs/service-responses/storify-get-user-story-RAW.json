weeks to learn about the basics.<br></div><div><br>Option (2): Attend a 'Mysore' morning practice. &nbsp;You may see that for some yoga studios and gyms, there is an early practice option (and occasionally evening) called Mysore practice. &nbsp;Mysore is actually the founding location of Ashtanga yoga, and that in the ashram in Mysore, students usually drop in during early mornings within a given period to practice Ashtanga yoga through the guidance of the resident teachers. &nbsp;In modern day studios, the time frame is usually set between 6am-10am and you can drop in any time and leave any time. &nbsp;If you are new to the practice or the studio, a good teacher will greet you and adapt the practice for your level. &nbsp;A lot of practitioners swear by Mysore self-practice as the&nbsp;group energy in the room is usually very focused and inspiring, and also you get the attention of the teacher for poses you need the most.</div><div><br>Option (3): Attend a led, mixed-level

their first exposure to Ashtanga. &nbsp;Because everyone has a different body and that a led-class only provides one speed for all those postures, as a beginner to Ashtanga or a complete beginner to yoga, it can sometimes be too much. &nbsp;To give Ashtanga yoga a fair chance, you may want to start with option (1) or (2).

with for over 3 years). &nbsp;However, I have practised with other yogis who have injured through forceful adjustments from their teachers. &nbsp;It is a fine line between pushing over the edge and
